I am a proficient English technical writer and editor with a Ph.D. in Computer Hardware Engineering from the University of Toronto, bringing over a decade of experience in writing, editing, and producing high-quality content. My expertise spans academic and industrial settings, including authoring and editing technical specifications, user manuals, academic journal articles, and conference papers. I specialize in creating user-centric documentation and writing clear, precise content that simplifies complex concepts for various audiences, from technical experts to end-users.
In my role as a technical writer and editor, I have developed a strong sense of writing style and honed my skills in evaluating the clarity, accuracy, and relevance of text. I have experience in fact-checking and re-writing prompts and responses to ensure they are logically structured, factually accurate, and accessible. This has equipped me with the attention to detail necessary to identify the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated content and provide constructive feedback to enhance the quality of AI models. My expertise extends to understanding complex technical topics and breaking them down into clear, actionable content, which is essential for ensuring that AI models generate responses that align with real-world applications.
I am well-suited to assess and rank AI-generated responses, leveraging my writing and editing background to provide accurate evaluations of the factuality and relevance of the text. Additionally, my experience with writing and editing across a range of genres gives me the flexibility and adaptability needed for the tasks at hand, including research and fact-checking.
